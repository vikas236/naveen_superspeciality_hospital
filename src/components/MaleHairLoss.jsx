          <h1>Conditions That We Treat.</h1>
          <p>
            This is the most common form of hair loss that affects most men and
            what we commonly refer to when we say that someone is ‘going bald.’.
          </p>
          <h2>Causes</h2>
          <p>
            The thinning of the hair occurs predominantly due to genetic factors
            which are inherited from both your mother and fathers’ side of the
            family
          </p>
          <h2>Treatments</h2>
          <p>
            There are medications that can be taken to help stop the progression
            of baldness and be used to stimulate hair growth. Hair Restoration
            is also a common option to regain more hair into a previously
            balding area. It is important to see an experienced professional
            skilled at diagnosing this condition and managing it.

            It’s no secret that having a full head of lustrous hair can offer
            many advantages in a number of settings. Sure, you can go for the
            “bald eagle” look, but the amount of added maintenance involved with
            daily shaving is just another grooming-hassle that you don’t need!

            self-confidence dramatically improves after they complete their
            hair-restoration experience with naveenhfc (Naveen Superspeciality Hospital).
