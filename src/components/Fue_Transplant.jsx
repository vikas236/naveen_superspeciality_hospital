          <p>
            At Naveen Superspeciality hospital, we understand that hair loss can
            impact your confidence. We use the latest techniques for FUE
            transplant to offer the best results. Follicular Unit Excision is
            also referred to as Follicular Unit Extraction and is a procedure
            that involves the extraction of follicles in their natural groupings
            from areas of dense growth. This is usually from the side or back of
            the head. The procedure involves small punches through which the
            individual hair follicles are removed. The follicles are then
            harvested and prepared to be placed in the donor area. The grafts
            consist of 1, 2 or 3 hairs that are transplanted in a way so that
            the natural look is maintained. If you are keen to find out more
            about FUE hair transplant, book an appointment with us to learn
            more.

            The first step involves preparation to make the hair transplant
            effective. In the next step, the hair follicles are extracted using
            local anaesthetic. A specialised instrument is used for precision,
            and first, the hair follicles are loosened. The removed hair
            follicles are then placed on the roots of the recipient area.

              the original hair.
            </li>
            <li>
              <i class="bx bx-check"></i>Aftercare is vital for the regrowth
