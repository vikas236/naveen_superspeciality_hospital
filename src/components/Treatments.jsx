            Hair loss, also known as alopecia, is a natural occurrence where the
            average person can lose around 100 hairs per day. Men and women can

          <h1>Types of Hair Loss In Men</h1>
          <p>
            Hair loss, commonly referred to as male pattern baldness, can affect
            both men and women and is scientifically known as androgenic
            alopecia. This genetic condition can be hereditary and often leads
            to hair loss in the teenage years.
          </p>
          <p>
            Androgenic alopecia develops due to a combination of factors
            including:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Genetic Predisposition: Certain genes inherited from family
              members can make individuals more susceptible to hair loss.
            </li>
            <li>
              Aging process: As individuals age, the likelihood of experiencing
              hair loss increases.
            </li>
            <li>
              Hormones and Receptors: The presence of hormones, particularly the
              male sex hormone DHT (dihydrotestosterone) and corresponding
              receptors play a role in the development of hair loss.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Hair loss in men occurs as a result of DHT triggering a process
            called follicular miniaturisation. Over time, hair follicles shrink
            and cease to produce new hair growth.{" "}
          </p>
          <p>
            If you are experiencing hair loss first at the crown and hairline or
            the back and sides of your head, you should consider going for a
            <b>hair loss treatment</b>.

        <h1>Types of Hair Loss In Women</h1>
        <p>
          Female pattern baldness can be initiated by androgenic alopecia.
          Interestingly, the same hormone responsible for male pattern baldness,
          DHT (dihydrotestosterone) also plays a role in female hair loss. Hair
          loss in women differs from men, as it typically results in diffuse
          thinning across the top of the scalp rather than a specific bald spot.
          The hairline is generally maintained. As women age, more than 55%
          experience mild hair loss, while around 20% may encounter moderate to
          severe hair loss.

            This needs to be done carefully to minimize damage to the grafts and
            also to make sure that the donor area after harvesting the hair does
            not look barren. These grafts are then carefully extracted, leaving
            microscopic dot-like scars spread out over the large donor area.
            These grafts are then carefully placed in the recipient area to give
            a natural and dense appearance.

            The main attractive element of FUE is the fact that it leaves a
            minimal amount of scarring. Certainly within two weeks, there is
            very little evidence that one has had any grafts harvested. Also,
            due to the lack of any sutures (as with FUT), the post-operative
            care and experience is a lot more simple and pain free.

          <h1>Body Hair Transplantation.</h1>
          <p>
            In certain circumstances where there is insufficient donor hair from
            the scalp, body hair has been found to be an acceptable substitute.
            Potential donor areas are beard, chest, and back. These grafts are
            skilfully harvested using the FUE technique and transplanted into
            the recipient area. Not all body hair is created equally. Certain
            types of body hair are more amenable to transplantation and this is
            dependant on what proportion of the hairs are in the ‘active’
            growing phase. Beard hair is usually the best from this perspective
            and is useful when more density is required (in non frontal line
            areas).
