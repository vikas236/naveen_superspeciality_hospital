          <h1>Beard and Moustaches.</h1>
          <p>
            From the standpoint of facial aesthetics, one of the big benefits of
            growing a beard is that it can strengthen a weak jawline. The fuller
            the beard, the more powerful the effect.
          </p>
          <h2>Causes</h2>
          <p>
            In most cases, poor beard growth is usually something that you are
            just born with and as such is unlikely to improve on it’s own. In
            certain cases, patchy loss of hair in the beard can be due to other
            causes. It is important for you to be assessed by an experienced
            professional and the appropriate treatment commenced. .
          </p>
          <h2>Treatments</h2>
          <p>
            If you are just born with insufficient facial hair, then hair
            transplant is an effective and permanent solution to add thickness
            and density to the area.
